# About the Name: Goloo

## The Fifth Element (1997)

Luc Besson's science fiction film features Leeloo (Milla Jovovich), an orange-haired "Supreme Being" who holds the key to saving Earth. Throughout the film, Leeloo carries a "multipass" - a universal identification card that grants access to restricted areas.

In one memorable scene, Leeloo repeatedly presents her multipass to security, enthusiastically declaring "Multipass!" in her distinctive accent. The scene became a cult reference, beloved by fans for its humor and Jovovich's delivery.

## Ubuntu Multipass

Canonical named their lightweight VM manager after this scene. Multipass creates Ubuntu virtual machines with a single command - a "pass" that grants quick access to fresh Ubuntu environments.

The connection is deliberate:
- **Universal access**: One tool works across Linux, macOS, and Windows
- **Quick entry**: Single command to spin up a VM
- **The orange branding**: Multipass uses coral/orange colors echoing Leeloo's hair

## Goloo

**Goloo** combines:
- **Go** - The programming language (and its gopher mascot)
- **Leeloo** - The Fifth Element character

The name captures the tool's essence:
- Written in Go
- Spiritual successor to Multipass concepts
- Universal access to VMs (local or cloud)
- One "pass" to provision anywhere

### Pronunciation

"GOO-loo" - rhymes with "voodoo"

### Why Not Just "Leeloo"?

Character names from films can have trademark complications. "Goloo" is:
- Original (no trademark issues)
- Clearly indicates the Go language
- Short and easy to type
- Memorable

### The Gopher Connection

Go's mascot is a gopher. Gophers:
- Dig tunnels (like SSH tunnels to VMs)
- Create burrows (like VM environments)
- Are industrious (like the tool)

Goloo could be imagined as a gopher who also carries a multipass.

## In Use

```bash
goloo create devbox           # Local VM (like Leeloo's multipass)
goloo create devbox --aws     # Cloud VM (universal access)
```

One tool, one config, anywhere you need to go.
